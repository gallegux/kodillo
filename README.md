light gui for omxplayer

kodillo is a graphical interface for omxplayer with the sole purpose of watching videos in RaspberryPi. 
XBMC and KODI consume too many resources simply to launch a video with the remote control (in my Raspberry 1 at least yes), and using omxplayer by command line is very tedious. 
The graphical interface is light, requires few resources and is fast. You can control it with the TV's remote control, of course the RaspberryPi and the TV are connected by HDMI.
